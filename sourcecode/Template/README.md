# C# to Common C
## THE LANGUAGE to rule them all!

There is too many C dialects. The goal is to create a truly platform independent superset of C2x, that unites the best of the variousdialects with the ease of _C#_ and the intentions of Objective-C without the .NET runtime

It is a minor library called _Common C_ will be from _C#_,_C++_, _Objective-C_, _Object Pascal_, Comal80 etc. to even out the differences between _C#_ and _C_.

In a perfect world _c# code_ could be compiled with a _C compiler_, but this is not yet possible. In time _Common C_ might be the favoured programming language for beginners and experienced programmers.

## Key differences between C# and C
- c has no _string_ keyword - use char instead e.g. `char *stringField`
- no _namespaces_
- not __Object Oriented Programming__ (OOP) oriented 
- no _garbage collection_
- _C_ has pointers, which is considered _unsafe code_ in _C#_

## Intended improvements
- __Common C__ _Nuget-package_ with templates
- _OOP_ and _namespaces_ in _Common C
